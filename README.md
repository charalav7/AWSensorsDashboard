# AWSensorsDashboard
This app is intended for collection of sensor data from an android smartwatch, in order to send them through an android mobile to IBM Bluemix with MQTT protocol.

It collects only Accelerometer and Gyroscope data from the watch, but it can be easily expanded to other types of sensors.
It runs in the background, both for wear and mobile.
